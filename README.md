## VITyarthi-PROJECT-AQI-DETECTION
OVERVIEW:


The AQI Detection System is a Python-based application designed to calculate the Air Quality Index (AQI) for two major air pollutants: PM2.5 and PM10. It uses official US EPA AQI breakpoints to compute accurate AQI values through linear interpolation.
Air pollution levels can be difficult to interpret directly from raw particulate matter readings, so this system simplifies the process by converting pollutant concentrations into:
An understandable AQI score (0–500)
A meaningful air quality category (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, Hazardous)
The system is completely interactive and allows users to input PM2.5 and PM10 values. It then processes these inputs, calculates AQI for each pollutant, and determines the overall AQI based on EPA guidelines.

FEATURES:

1)calculate AQI for pm2.5 and pm10

2)uses linear interpolation (EPA FORMULA)

3)determines air quality category

4)user friendly CLI interface


TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOL USED:
